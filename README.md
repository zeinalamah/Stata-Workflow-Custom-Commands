# Stata Workflow and Custom Commands

This repository provides:
1. **An Example Stata Workflow**: Demonstrates how custom commands can automate a research workflow, from data preparation to generating a Word document output.
2. **Custom Commands**: Reusable Stata commands developed to streamline econometric analysis.

## Why This Repository?

During my work as a research assistant, I developed custom Stata commands to streamline repetitive tasks, accelerate analysis, and ensure standardized outputs. These tools helped me immensely in managing large datasets and complex workflows.

While I cannot share the code for the actual research papers I contributed to, this repository serves as an educational resource, providing:
- An example of how a well-structured Stata workflow looks.
- Guidance on using custom commands to enhance research efficiency.

## Rationale for Custom Commands

### Why Use Custom Commands?
Custom commands in Stata:
- **Accelerate Workflows**:
  - Automate repetitive tasks like variable transformations, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and exporting results.
  - Allow you to focus on interpreting findings rather than formatting outputs.
- **Standardize Processes**:
  - Ensure consistency and reproducibility in outputs.
  - Embed best practices into reusable scripts, reducing errors and saving time.

## Example: Innovation Workflow

The `Innovation_Workflow_Example` folder demonstrates how custom commands can be integrated into a research workflow using the **World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES)** dataset. While the dataset is not included in this repository due to size and legal constraints, you can download it from the [World Bank Enterprise Survey website](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/).

This workflow is an educational example that:
- Illustrates how to structure a research workflow.
- Provides custom commands that automate processes like subsample analysis and exporting results into Word documents.

### How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the WBES dataset from the [World Bank Enterprise Survey website](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/).
3. Update the dataset path in the `Innovation_Paper.do` file.
4. Run the workflow (`Innovation_Paper.do`) to explore how the custom commands simplify complex analysis tasks.
